This a CONTOUR-A endeavor funded by [Research Corporation for Science Advancement](https://rescorp.org/).

## Common Elements

When constructing a set of group norms and policies for a research
group, one may wish to include statements about the following
elements. This is intended to be comprehensive list of points for
reflection, but effective statements need not include all components:

### Welcome statement

- What is the name of your group? What is the nature of your research?

- Who’s who in the research group? What responsibilities do they have?

- **Statement from the group leader**: Sometimes students don’t realize
that their advisors do more than teaching. What do you want students
to know about your responsibilities and time commitments? Are there
any special circumstances that students should know about that might
affect the group leader’s availability (e.g., sabbatical, family
leave)?

- **Respect and Inclusivity Values statement**: What positive aspects of
research and teamwork do you want to emphasize to students?  What
qualities do you want students to develop as part of this research
experience?

- **Code of conduct**: Do you have your own code-of-conduct or is there a
central code-of-conduct agreed upon by your department? Oftentimes
people will link to a separate document or website. Is there anything
you would add to the departmental code-of-conduct? Some elements of a
code of conduct and values statement could include:
    - **Commitment to a Respectful Environment**: Emphasize treating all
members with respect, regardless of personal characteristics such as
race, gender, sexual orientation, and more.  Valuing Diverse
Perspectives: Recognition of the value that diverse perspectives bring
to the research group.
    - **Creating an Inclusive Environment**: Active efforts to ensure all
members feel valued and included.  How to navigate a conflict: Who
should students go to when there is an issue inside the group? Who
should they go to if there is an issue outside of the research group?
What are the formal and informal reporting mechanisms? This is also a
good place to link to external professional development resources
about conflict.
    - **Valuing Diverse Perspectives**: Recognition of the value that diverse perspectives bring to the research group.
    - **Creating an Inclusive Environment**: Active efforts to ensure all members feel valued and included.
    - **How to navigate a conflict**: Who should students go to when there is an issue inside the group? Who should they go to if there is an issue outside of the research group? What are the formal and informal reporting mechanisms? This is also a good place to link to external professional development resources about conflict.

### Onboarding Process

- **Orientation Sessions**: You may want to consider a structured orientation for new members to understand group norms and expectations.

- **Comprehension Assessments**: You may want to use quizzes or other methods to ensure new members understand the group's guidelines.

- **Onboarding Assignments**: Are there activities (e.g., reading papers, reproducing plots, demonstrating coding prowess) you would like the student to complete before becoming a full/paid member of your group?

### Student Responsibilities

- **Contact with your Advisor**: How often will students meet with their research advisor and/or group leader? What should students prepare before attending these meetings? Who will take notes during the meeting?

- **Documenting your Work**: Describe how students should keep a lab notebook or use version control.

- **Back up all research materials**: Describe the preferred mechanism, highlighting data storage platforms your institution may have access to (e.g., OneDrive, Dropbox).

- **Sharing Research Materials**: All work needs to be transparent, reproducible, and shareable. Where should students share the results of their research with you (e.g., Google drive, Dropbox, github)? Describe what materials should be placed in this shared system (e.g., what types of data products, codes, research logs).

- **Growing your Scientific Knowledge**: It is the students' responsibility to demonstrate intellectual curiosity by attending and engaging in various seminars/colloquia, and regularly reading papers.

- **Presenting your Work**: Describe the venues in which students are expected to present their work (and the cadence: weekly group meetings? journal club once a semester? a poster at the end of the summer?)

- **Public Outreach/Broader Impacts**: Describe expectations of group members to give back to their communities. You might want to list service roles they can consider participating in, or venues for participating in public outreach. 
    - Be transparent if this is a condition of student funding, and if they can bill your grant for these hours.

### Collaboration and Communication Norms

- **Teamwork and Support**: Encourage cooperative work and mutual support among group members including peer, near-peer, and more senior supervision and mentoring.

- **Communication Tools**: Be clear about how (email? Slack? Carrier pigeons?) students can get in touch with advisors and each other. You may want to stress norms about responding to emails and/or messages outside of work hours.

- **Availability**: What are the norms for physical presence and/or online availability, as a way to support the research productivity of other members of the research group?

- **Calendars**: What is the group schedule? Is there a shared group calendar? Is there a departmental calendar of events that students need to be aware of?

- **Requesting Letters of Recommendation**: How much lead time do students need to give for letters of recommendation? What mode of communication should they use to make a request (e.g., email, google form)? How should they organize communication around deadlines (e.g., list of program deadlines, fellowship websites and criteria)? You may need to explain to them that they can enter your information into a graduate student application portal in order to initiate the letter request process before finishing their application submission.

### Mentoring and Support

- **Feedback Mechanisms**: How often will students receive feedback? How will that feedback be communicated? You may want to stress that research is iterative, and they will receive many rounds of feedback from their advisor before the project is complete.

- **Assigned Mentors**: Designate mentors to guide and support new and existing members.  Clarify when students should ask for help, and who to ask; clarify expectations of more senior group members as mentors.

- **Regular Check-Ins**: The student and advisor should plan on scheduled one-on-one or small group meetings to address any challenges and make consistent progress on the project. Consider cadence, duration, and scheduling: weekly? fortnightly? Also mention other research group commitments, like group meetings.

- **Strategic planning/Goal setting**: You may want to require regular strategic plans/individualized development plans for your students, developed in collaboration with the advisor. Elements of a strategic plan to consider:
    - Students self-assess strengths
    - Students self-assess skills that need development
    - Students reflect on long-term goals
    - Students set short-term and long-term goals (which could include goals for personal life and wellbeing)
    - Discussion with the advisor on the students' answers to the above elements

- **Building your Network**: The best mentoring comes from a team of mentors, who can combine their diverse expertise to support you as a whole person. Encourage students to expand their network, and highlight the opportunities students have for attending workshops, conferences, and other professional development activities.

### Expectations around Time Commitment:

- **Work Hours**: How many hours a week should your students aim to work, and what activities count as work? Make clear the expectations about when they should work. Consider allowing for flexible work hours to accommodate individual needs. 

- **Remote Work**: Address whether or not students are allowed to work remotely. What tools do you use to facilitate remote work? In what situations are students expected to engage in-person?

- **Personal Time Off**: Describe how much time off (planned or unplanned) is appropriate for students to take. Give other expectations, such as how much advance notice and whether/how these should be documented (not necessarily with details, but possibility just availability or lack thereof).

- **Punctuality and Deadlines**: Describe your general expectations for punctuality in meetings and project deadlines.

- **Length of Project**: If a student begins a project with you and you invest time training them, is there a minimum number of weeks/months/semesters you expect them to work with you? Can students expect the opportunity to work in the group until they graduate?

### Research Integrity and Ethics

- **Honesty and Transparency**: Prioritize honesty in reporting research findings and methodologies.

- **Ethical Guidelines**: Stress that we adhere to ethical standards in all research activities.  Consider outlining your expectations about use of AI in research, and/or including a discussion of plagiarism and giving appropriate credit to others.

- **Authorship on Scientific Papers**: Describe what work is entailed to earn first authorship on a scientific paper. Explain how the rest of the authorship list is decided.

### What Happens When Expectations Are Not Met

- **Formative and Summative Feedback**: How/when will you communicate if a student is not meeting expectations, and what are their options when that occurs? If the student is doing research for a grade, what constitutes a passing grade, and when/how will progress toward the grade be communicated? See also section on feedback in “Support and Mentoring”

- **Ending research relationship**: Under what circumstances might a student be asked to leave the group? Consider research outcomes as well as other aspects of research agreement.

### Individual Research Expectations

It is recommended that you have a section at the end of the document, or a separate document, that is personalized for an individual student/project. It could include:

- Their research project description.

- Skills they will develop as part of this research

- Expected outcomes (data products? written reports?)

- An outline of the research project milestones with a tentative timeline

- The advisors or other group members the student should plan to interact with often. If there are multiple advisors, it might be helpful to explain their different roles/strengths.

- **Time Commitment**: How many hours a week is the student expected to work? What budget do you have to support the student(s) on this project? 

- **Compensation**: Is this research for course credit, or are they getting paid? How much are they being paid? What types of activities are billable?

- How should students log their hours and submit their timesheets?

- Is there a capstone assessment the student is working toward, like a poster or a talk?

### Testing student comprehension of research norms

Some people give students a quiz (e.g., via Google forms) to test that they have read and understood essential points of the research norms document. Misconceptions can be cleared up quickly at the start of the research experience.
